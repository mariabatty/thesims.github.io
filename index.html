        <h1 id="title">The Sims</h1>
        <p id="text">The Sims is a life simulation game series that was developed by Maxis and The Sims Studio and published by Electronic
            Arts. The franchise has sold nearly 200 million copies worldwide, and it is one of the best-selling video games
            series of all time.
            <br> The series was created by Maxis, before the development of the series transitioned to The Sims Studio between
            2006 and 2008. The Sims Studio later reintegrated into the refreshed EA Maxis label in 2012, where it continues
            to be developed by both teams. The games in The Sims series are largely sandbox games, in that they lack any
            defined goals (except for some later expansion packs and console versions which introduced this gameplay style).
            <br> The player creates virtual people called "Sims" and places them in houses and helps direct their moods and satisfy
            their desires. Players can either place their Sims in pre-constructed homes or build them themselves. Each successive
            expansion pack and game in the series augmented what the player could do with their Sims.
